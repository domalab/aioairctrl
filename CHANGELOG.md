## Development Notes

### Version 0.2.6 Improvements Summary

This release represents a major modernization and quality improvement of the philips-airctrl library:

1. **Testing Infrastructure**: Added comprehensive test suite covering encryption, client functionality, and CLI operations with proper async mocking.

2. **Code Quality**: Implemented modern Python development practices including type hints, code formatting, and linting.

3. **Project Structure**: Migrated to modern pyproject.toml configuration and removed deprecated setup.py.

4. **Documentation**: Significantly enhanced README with detailed usage examples, API reference, and development guidelines.

5. **Development Workflow**: Added pre-commit hooks, CI/CD pipeline, and automated quality checks.

6. **Maintainability**: Improved error handling, fixed code quality issues, and added proper async patterns.

### Migration Guide from 0.2.5 to 0.2.6

The API remains backward compatible, but there are some development-related changes:

- **Python Version**: Now requires Python 3.8+ (was 3.6+)
- **Installation**: No changes to installation process
- **API**: All existing API calls remain the same
- **CLI**: All existing CLI commands work unchanged

For developers:
- Use `pip install -e ".[dev]"` for development dependencies
- Run tests with `pytest` instead of manual testing
- Use `black` for code formatting
- Use `pre-commit` for automated quality checks

### Future Roadmap

- Add support for more Philips air purifier models
- Implement device discovery functionality
- Add configuration file support
- Enhance error messages and user feedback
- Add integration with home automation systems
